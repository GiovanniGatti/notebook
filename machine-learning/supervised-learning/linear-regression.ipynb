This method looks at every example in the entire training set on every step, and is called **batch gradient descent**. It is also important that, while gradient descent can be susceptible to local minima in general, the optimization problem we have posed here for linear regression has only one global, and no other local, optima; thus **gradient descent always converges** (assuming the learning rate $\\alpha$ is not too large) to the global minimum.\n",
